# SpinningCube
This project is a simple 3D ASCII cube renderer implemented in Python. It visualizes a rotating cube using ASCII characters in a console environment. The program calculates the perspective projection of the cube's vertices based on trigonometric functions, allowing for a dynamic and animated representation.
